# Introduction
## A Gentle Introduction to Predictive Modelling

Predictive modelling and machine learning has recently become increasingly important in biomedical
research and holds promise for delivering biomarkers that substantially impact
clinical practice and public health 
{cite:p}`vogt2018machine, kent2018personalized, spisak2020pain, walsh2021dome`.

For many researchers, "machine learning" belongs to those mysterious analysis techniques,
that are more familiar from science-fiction than their actual research activity.
At the same time many of these researchers routinely apply rather complex statistical techniques 
like mixed-effect models and find their way in highly complex analysis workflows of analysis software environments,
dedicated to their fields.

This lecture book is meant for these type of researchers,
to demystify predictive modelling and machine learning and to show
that the simplest - but yet very powerful - forms of these analysis techniques are as much accessible
as "classical" tools for statistical inference, they routinely use.

For many of these simple machine learning techniques,
their novelty might be the only reason they are not yet as widespread as classical descriptive statistical inference.

This book aims to provide a practical hands-on experience and illustrates all the basic concepts
by analyzing and example dataset with python code. These pages of the book (called notebooks) are interactive:
they can be run either on a local workstation or - with just one click - on the cloud.
The book contains exercises which require the reader to modify the code.

It is encouraged to go through the book with an own dataset, instead of the example dataset.
This way, although more challenging, will make the reader deeply *internalize* the core concepts
and - hopefully - push her over the entry limit for applying predictive modelling in her own research.

While this lecture book focuses on simple and easily explainable machine learning models,
it also highlights, how the paradigm of predictive modelling makes it possible to use "black box" model,
without having to sacrifice confidence in the reliability of the predictions.

This is not a conventional lecture book, it is constantly developed.
