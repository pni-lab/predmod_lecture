# A Gentle Introduction to Predictive Modelling

Predictive modelling has recently become increasingly important in biomedical
research and holds promise for delivering biomarkers that substantially impact
clinical practice and public health 
{cite:p}`vogt2018machine, kent2018personalized, spisak2020pain, walsh2021dome`.
When evaluating the usefulness and applicability of such markers, predictive performance
is far from being the only important consideration. Biomedical validity
(i.e. whether the model is driven by biomedically relevant signal) as well as 
generalizability and fairness across contexts and populations are also fundamental 
requirements for candidate biomarkers 
{cite:p}`woo2017building, obermeyer2019dissecting, mehrabi2021survey`.
